    Description:
		Checks that objects in the 'sites_object_zfixer_objects' localNamespace variable 
		have z-axis position >= 0 and if not, makes them >= 0.

		During site spawns, we manually set the z-axis of positions to 0. But for some
		reason mortars keep falling below the terrain.
		
		So this has been implemented as a 'nuclear' fail safe. i.e. something is very wrong,
		brute force deal with it.

		This was rewritten from the paradigm fallthrough checker system
		- while loops make code unreadable most of the time
		- we need 0 AGLS Z-pos, not -1 ATL or ASL Z-pos

		We do iterate over the objects to check several times, but we shouldn't see too much
		of a performance impact as this job runs on a very slow schedule.
    
    Parameter(s):
		none

    Returns:
		None
    
    Example(s):
		[] call vn_mf_fnc_sites_object_zfixer_job;

if object AGLS Z-coord is less than 0 then reset it to 0.

have Z-co-ords in the range -1x10^-8 < x < -0.05 etc. so we test 
for objects with Z-co-ords less than -0.1
